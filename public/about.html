<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a passionate and dedicated BScIT student specializing in Web Development and Software Development. I’m deeply interested in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications that make a real impact.</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in programming and a growing knowledge of the latest web technologies, I’m always learning, experimenting, and refining my skills. I enjoy solving problems through code, turning ideas into digital solutions, and working on meaningful projects—both independently and as part of a team.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m focused on front-end and back-end development, and I’m excited about future opportunities in full-stack development, cloud integration, and AI-powered web apps.</p>
